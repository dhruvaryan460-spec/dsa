# Linked List Operations in C

This project demonstrates basic singly linked list operations in C:
- Insert at the beginning
- Traverse (display all elements)
- Delete the first element
- Delete a node by value (function provided)

## How to Use
1. Compile the code using GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc link_list.c -o link_list.exe
   ```
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   link_list.exe
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen menu to insert, traverse, or delete elements.

## Menu Options
- **1. Insert element:** Add one or more elements at the beginning of the list.
- **2. Traverse element:** Display all elements in the list.
- **3. Delete element:** Delete the first element in the list.
- **(Optional) Delete by value:** Use the `delete_ll` function in code to delete a node by value.
- **0. Exit:** Quit the program.

## File Structure
- `link_list.c` — Main C source file with all linked list functions.

## Requirements
- GCC compiler (MinGW recommended for Windows)
- Windows OS (uses `windows.h` for Sleep and system commands)
